# This is an example file showing what parameter values can be given to
#   SimTreeSDD.
# Typical usage is simply
#         SimTreeSDD params_SimTreeSDD.dat,
# but values given here can be overruled with the command line call,
#   e.g.  SimTreeSDD params_SimTreeSDD.dat birth0=1.0 file_prefix=useme
# or everything can be specified on the command line.
